# 6. CHALLENGES/DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING THE APPLICATION

## 6.1 Authentication Page 
### 1. Login Redirection Issues
After successful login, users were not redirected to the correct dashboard, causing confusion and requiring manual navigation.

***Solution***: Ensure correct redirection by setting the intended URL using Laravel’s redirect()->intended('/dashboard') method.

### 2. 4. CSRF Token Mismatch Errors
Users encountered "CSRF token mismatch" errors during login and registration due to expired or missing tokens.

***Solution***: Ensure that @csrf is included in all authentication forms and handle token expiration properly.

## 6.2 Home Page
### 1. Design Consistency

Ensuring the layout, colors, and typography are visually appealing and consistent across the page.

***Solution***: Use a design system or CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

## 6.3 Patient Registration Page 
### 1.Unable to view the views/interface at the browser.

**Solution** Download Git and make sure the project's file is cloned inside the xampp/htdocs folder.

### 2.some errors with the database

***Solution*** Use the command ``` php artisan migrate:fresh ``` to drop all the table and migrate it again.

## 6.4 Appointment Scheduling Page 
### 1. Undefined Variables Due to Typos
Typos in route names ($appointment to $appointments) lead to undefined variable errors.
**Solution:** Double-check variable names to ensure consistency throughout the code.


## 6.5 Billing and Invoice Page
### 1. Incorrect Calculation of VAT and Total Amount
Errors in VAT and subtotal calculations led to incorrect final billing amounts, causing discrepancies in invoices.

***Solution***: Ensure proper formula implementation for VAT and total amount calculations and validate inputs before processing.

### 2. Payment Status Not Updating
The payment status (PAID or UNPAID) did not update correctly after completing a transaction, leading to confusion in invoice tracking.

***Solution***: Implement proper event listeners or database triggers to update the payment status upon successful payment confirmation.

## 6.6 Medical Records Page 
### 1. Undefined Variables Due to Typos
Typos in variable names ($medicals to $medical) lead to undefined variable errors.

**Solution:** Double-check variable names to ensure consistency throughout the code.

### 2. Not Running the Migration
Skipping the database migration prevents changes from reflecting in the database, causing errors.

**Solution:** Always run php artisan migrate after making database changes.

## 6.7 Doctor Management Page
### 1. 404 Page not found
Error occurred due to improper routing in web.php or incorrect href attribute. 

### 2. 419 Page expired
Error occurred due to issues such as typographical errors, incomplete HTML structure, or improper closure of code elements.

### 3. Undefined Variable
Error occurred due to an undefined variable doctor that caused by failure to properly pass or initialize the variable in the controller or view.

## 6.8 Pharmacy Management Page 
### 1. Undefined Variables Due to Typos
Typos when coding by changing from 'drug' to 'drugs'
### 2. Connection to PhpmyAdmin
My data did not updated in the phpmyAdmin database after many tries,after the help of internet,
I eventually solved it.
