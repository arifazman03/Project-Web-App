# 6. CHALLENGES/DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING THE APPLICATION

## 6.1 Authentication Page 

## 6.2 Home Page

## 6.3 Patient Registration Page 
### 1.Unable to view the views/interface at the browser.

**Solution** Download Git and make sure the project's file is cloned inside the xampp/htdocs folder.

###2.some errors with the database

***Solution*** Use the command ``` php artisan migrate:fresh ``` to drop all the table and migrate it again.

## 6.4 Appointment Scheduling Page 
### 1. Undefined Variables Due to Typos
Typos in route names ($appointment to $appointments) lead to undefined variable errors.


## 6.5 Billing and Invoice Page

## 6.6 Medical Records Page 
### 1. Undefined Variables Due to Typos
Typos in variable names ($medicals to $medical) lead to undefined variable errors.

**Solution:** Double-check variable names to ensure consistency throughout the code.

### 2. Not Running the Migration
Skipping the database migration prevents changes from reflecting in the database, causing errors.

**Solution:** Always run php artisan migrate after making database changes.

## 6.7 Doctor Management Page

## 6.8 Pharmacy Management Page 
### 1. Undefined Variables Due to Typos
Typos when coding by changing from 'drug' to 'drugs'
### 2. Connection to PhpmyAdmin
